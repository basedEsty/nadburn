# Workspace

## Overview

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Stack

- **Monorepo tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js version**: 24
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **TypeScript version**: 5.9
- **API framework**: Express 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **Build**: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server locally

See the `pnpm-workspace` skill for workspace structure, TypeScript setup, and package details.

## NadBurn — Web3 dust burner

### Vercel deployment (frontend on nadburn.xyz)

`artifacts/ash/vercel.json` ships a SPA rewrite so client-side routes
(`/app`, `/some-other-route`) fall through to `index.html` instead of
returning Vercel's default 404. Set the Vercel project **Root Directory**
to `artifacts/ash` so this config is picked up.

The rewrite excludes `/api/*` so it doesn't shadow API calls. Since the
Express api-server isn't on Vercel, you'll need one of:
- A Vercel rewrite proxying `/api/(.*)` to the deployed api-server URL
  (add a rule like `{ "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "https://your-api-server.replit.app/api/$1" }`
  to `vercel.json`), **or**
- Deploy the api-server elsewhere (Replit Deployments, Fly, Railway) and
  point a `VITE_API_URL` env var at it for absolute API URLs.

The api-server's CSRF/CORS allowlist accepts origins from
`PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN` — set it to `https://nadburn.xyz` in the api-server
env so cross-origin requests from Vercel are accepted.

### Architecture

Two artifacts make up the app:
- `artifacts/ash` — React + Vite frontend (wallet connect, token discovery, burn/recover UI). Public-facing.
- `artifacts/api-server` — Express backend (auth, burn history, saved tokens, explorer proxy, **Uniswap Trading API proxy**).

Supported chains:
| chainId | Network        | Recovery backend |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| 1       | Ethereum       | V2 router (on-chain) |
| 143     | Monad mainnet  | Uniswap Trading API (via backend proxy) |
| 10143   | Monad testnet  | V2 router (on-chain), dev only |

### Recovery on Monad mainnet (V4 / Trading API)

Monad mainnet is V4-only — there's no V2 router we can call directly. So
recovery routes through Uniswap's hosted Trading API, which builds the
swap calldata for the proxy Universal Router. We proxy these calls through
our api-server so the API key never reaches the browser.

**To enable recovery on Monad mainnet you need to set one secret on the api-server:**

1. Get a Trading API key:
   - Production / paid: https://hub.uniswap.org
   - Dev / playground: https://api-docs.uniswap.org (free key embedded in their docs site)
2. Add it as a Replit Secret named **`UNISWAP_TRADING_API_KEY`**:
   - In Replit: open the **Secrets** pane (lock icon in the left sidebar), click **New Secret**, set key = `UNISWAP_TRADING_API_KEY`, value = your key.
   - Or via shell: it lives in the same env that the api-server reads at startup.
3. Restart the `artifacts/api-server: API Server` workflow.

Without the secret set, the proxy returns `503 MISSING_UNISWAP_API_KEY` and the
frontend shows a yellow "key not configured" banner on chain 143 — burn
mode keeps working unaffected.

Backend proxy lives in `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/uniswap.ts`:
- Endpoints: `POST /api/uniswap/{check_approval,quote,swap}`
- Forwards to `https://trade-api.gateway.uniswap.org/v1/`
- Always sends `x-permit2-disabled: true` so users get plain
  approve-then-swap UX (no EIP-712 signatures)
- 32KB body cap, 15s timeout, allowlist of three endpoints (no SSRF)

Frontend client lives in `artifacts/ash/src/lib/uniswap-trading.ts`. The
recovery branching in `BurnerApp.tsx` keys off `RECOVERY_MODE[chainId]`
from `lib/constants.ts`.

### Auto-detect on Monad mainnet (Blockvision indexer)

Monad mainnet has no public Blockscout-compatible API for wallet token
balances (the official explorer is behind Cloudflare). To make
auto-detect actually find tokens in the user's wallet on chain 143, the
backend proxies through **Blockvision** (https://blockvision.org), which
has first-class Monad indexing.

**To enable:**

1. Sign up at https://blockvision.org (free tier is plenty for normal
   auto-detect traffic).
2. Create a project, pick the Monad chain, copy the API key.
3. Add it as a Replit Secret named **`BLOCKVISION_API_KEY`**.
4. Restart the `artifacts/api-server: API Server` workflow.

Without the secret, the proxy returns
`{ source: "missing-key", code: "MISSING_BLOCKVISION_API_KEY" }`, and
the frontend shows a "Monad auto-detect not configured" toast nudging
the user to paste tokens manually. Burn and recovery are unaffected.

Backend lives in the chain-143 branch of
`artifacts/api-server/src/routes/explorer.ts`:
- Endpoint: `GET https://api.blockvision.org/v2/monad/account/tokens`
- Auth: `x-api-key` header (server-side only)
- Filters out the native MON entry (zero address) — it's read separately
  via wagmi
- Successful responses cached for 15s; upstream errors and 429s are NOT
  cached so retries actually re-fetch
- 10s timeout, 1 MiB body cap, validates address format before forwarding
